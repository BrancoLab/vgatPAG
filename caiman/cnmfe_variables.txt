A:  scipy.sparse.csc_matrix (dimensions: # of pixels x # components)
    set of spatial footprints. Each footprint is represented in a column of A, flattened with order = 'F'

C:  np.ndarray (dimensions: # of components x # of timesteps)
    set of temporal traces (each row of C corresponds to a trace)

f:  np.ndarray (dimensions: # of background components x # of timesteps)
    set of temporal background components

b:  np.ndarray or scipy.sparse.csc_matrix (dimensions: # of pixels x # of background components)
    set of spatial background components, flattened with order = 'F'

R:  np.ndarray (dimensions: # of components x # of timesteps)
    set of trace residuals

YrA:    np.ndarray (dimensions: # of components x # of timesteps)
    set of trace residuals

S:  np.ndarray (dimensions: # of components x # of timesteps)
    set of deconvolved neural activity traces

F_dff:  np.ndarray (dimensions: # of components x # of timesteps)
    set of DF/F normalized activity traces (only for 2p)

W:  scipy.sparse.coo_matrix (dimensions: # of pixels x # of pixels)
    Ring model matrix (used in 1p processing with greedy_pnr for background computation)
